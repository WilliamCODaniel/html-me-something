            <h2>Captains</h2>
                <h3><a name="shark"> Shark</h3></a>
                    <p>
                        Shark is <strong>THE</strong> goal threat captain 
                        in all of Guild Ball.  Whether kicking off or receiving,
                        Shark has the tools to score from almost anywhere
                        on the pitch.  He wants the ball and the glory.
                        With the right combination of Squaddies,
                        a Shark led team is most likely to get a 3 goal win.
                    </p>

                <h3><a name="corsair"></a>Corsair</h3>
                    <p>
                        Corsair is the beater of the Fisherman's Guild.  
                        A Corsair led squad will be a little more focused on 
                        takeouts than goals, while still being flexible enough
                        to get a score or two.  Corsair wants to control his 
                        opponents movements via a variety of abilities that 
                        draw them in.  Add <a href="#Kraken">Kraken</a> to a 
                        Corsair team and you've got a strong one-two punch.
                    </p>

                <h3><a name="yukai"></a>Yukai</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yukai is the new Captain on the wharf, having only been
                        availible since March, 2019.  Yukai is more akin to Shark 
                        than Corsair yet feels incredibly unique when on the pitch.
                        Yukai wants to coach their squad to victory by passing out 
                        buffs and, in the case of their Legendary Play, extreme 
                        repositioning.  A Yukai led team will mainly focus on goals
                        and will rarely try to do much else.  Bring <a href="#fathom">Fathom</a>
                        and <a href="#angel">Angel</a> along for a potential 2 goal activation!

                <h3><a name="angel">Angel</a></h3>
                    <p>If Shark is the superstar striker Captain, then Angel is the 
                        Squaddie equivalent.  She can score from almost anywhere and is
                        very difficult to hit thanks to a 5+ DEF.  She's a <strong>MUST</strong>
                        in a Yukai led squad.
                    </p>

                <h3><a name="greyscales">Greyscales</a></h3>
                    <p>Greyscales is the elder statesman of the Fisherman's Guild.
                        He is a good addition to most squads thanks to his "Ball's Gone"
                        character play and unusual movement characteristics, specifically 
                        "Unpredictable Movement" which allows him to get away from engagements.
                    </p>

                <h3><a name="Hag">Hag</a></h3>
                    <p>Before Yukai there was Hag.  She is basically a command and control
                        Squaddie, moving her teammates around at will with "Fisher's Reel".
                        She is good at staying out of trouble while getting her teammates into 
                        proper positions on the pitch.  A good addition to a Shark or Corsair-led
                        squad.
                    </p>

                <h3><a name="jac">Jac</a></h3>
                    <p>Jac is a great addition to a Corsair-captained squad thanks to his
                        access to "Battering Ram" and "Goad".  His playbook is well suited to 
                        getting enemies into positions for Gang-Ups due to the easy access to Push
                        results.  Sakana is a generally preferred option to Jac, but Jac still 
                        has his uses.

                <h3><a name="kraken">Kraken</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        Kraken recently received a buff and is now well-suited to be a part 
                        of any Fisherman squad.  He is able to pull enemies in with "Drag" and 
                        once they are engaging him, they can't target anyone else!  He is fairly hardy
                        too thanks to the "Tough Hide" ability and his 1 armor.  He is now very 
                        close to the must-include category of Fish Squaddies.
                    </p>

                <h3><a name="Sakana">Sakana</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        Considered the ideal squaddie by some, Sakana is a welcome addition
                        to pretty much any Fisherman lineup.  He is very well rounded, with a 
                        decent Kick stat and good mobility.  When the game comes to blows, he's 
                        very capable thanks to his "Anatomical Precision" trait that allows him to 
                        ignore 1 armor.  Throw in a free Counter Attack once per turn, and he 
                        becomes quite formidible.

                    <p>
                        Veteran Sakana has seen more play recently thanks to the increased 
                        focus on the kicking game overall in Guild Ball.  V. Sakana still has 
                        "Anatomical Precision" which makes him good in a fight, but he now comes
                        with the ability to pass out an extra Influence to a teammate via "Bag of Coffers". 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Siren may not have a lot of health, but she is more than capable 
                        of holding her own.  She has seen a recent decline in lineups thanks 
                        to "Seduced" having it's ranged lowerd.  However, she is still able to 
                        do enough controlling of the other team that she warrants consideration.  
                        If you do include Siren, Kraken must come along for the ride thanks to her
                        "Protected" ability, which gives her +1 armor when Kraken is close.

                    <p>
                        Veteran Siren usually sees the pitch more than her non-Vet variant these days.
                        Her "Dread Gaze" ability is very useful for limiting opponents' ability
                        to move, thanks to a knockdown.  She is better at surviving this time around thanks to "Escaping Fate"
                        which allows her to go back to 1 HP after being reduced to 0 and make a 2" dodge 
                        to get out of harms way.

                        She is an excellent striker and a must-have Squaddie on a team with Yukai at the helm.
                        If everything goes right, a team with Fathom and Angel can score back-to-back goals
                        before the other team has a chance to activate!  Throw in an ability that allows
                        her to clear conditions and you have an excellent addition to any Fish squad (but especially Yukai).

                        as a red-herring to the other team due to his "Don't Get Cocky" ability, which 
                        only gives the other team 1 Victory Point for taking him out.  He is quite
                        mobile with a once per turn 5" dodge that could lead to some sneaky scoring.

                        If she can get into position, which isn't too difficult given 
                        her 17" threat range!  Definitlely the mascot of choice with Shark

                        Tentacles' "Blind" ability is very sueful for keeping the other team
                        from accomplishing it's plan.  Then throw in "Close Control" and you've
                        got a mascot that can (and should) be holding the ball.
